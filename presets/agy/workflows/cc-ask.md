  [cc: alias] Recommend one CodeConductor slash command from a natural-language
  problem. Does not start that workflow.

# Ask — recommend a slash command

Problem: $ARGUMENTS

This is a **router**, not a delivery workflow. Recommend exactly one command.
Do **not** run the recommended `/cc:` command unless the human confirms.

---

## Step 1 — Recommend (deterministic)

Run (local repo: `bun run dev`; published package: `npx cc-codeconductor`):

```bash
bun run dev ask "$ARGUMENTS" --output json
```

or:

```bash
npx cc-codeconductor ask "$ARGUMENTS" --output json
```

The catalog is only:

| Slash | When |
| ----- | ---- |
| `/cc:feature` | new behavior |
| `/cc:fix` | bug / regression |
| `/cc:refactor` | structure, no behavior change |
| `/cc:review` | inspect a diff/PR |
| `/cc:tdd-cycle` | red → green → refactor |
| `/cc:backlog` | create or append BACKLOG.md / objectives |
| `/cc:openspec` | BACKLOG / BC-xxx delivery |

If the CLI is unavailable, apply the same catalog and the same priority:
backlog (author) vs openspec (deliver) → tdd-cycle → review → refactor → fix → feature (default).

---

## Step 2 — Show and stop

Print:

- **Recommended:** the slash command
- **Why:** one or two sentences from the CLI `reason` (or your matching)

**STOP.** Wait for the human. Do not invoke the recommended workflow.

For a full preset inventory (skills, commands on disk), use `/cc:help` / `cc-help`.
