# Refactor Workflow

Refactor description: $ARGUMENTS

Describe what you want to refactor and why. Include:

- The current structure or pattern being changed
- The target structure or pattern
- The motivation (performance, readability, architectural alignment, etc.)
- Known risk areas or dependencies

---

## Prerequisite — Test coverage check

Before any role is adopted, verify that the code being refactored has adequate
test coverage.

A refactor without tests is not a refactor — it is a rewrite with unknown
behavioral consequences.

If coverage is insufficient:

1. **STOP**. Report the coverage gap.
2. Suggest running `/test-plan` first to establish coverage.
3. Do not proceed with the refactor until coverage is confirmed.

---

## Step 1 — Architectural justification (Architect role)

Adopt the **Architect** role as defined in `CLAUDE.md`. Always invoke this step
first, regardless of risk level. A refactor without a written justification is
scope creep in disguise.

Produce a Refactor Plan that includes:

- Statement of the problem with the current structure
- Proposed target structure and rationale
- Affected files and module boundaries
- Risk level: `low`, `medium`, or `high`
- Behavioral invariants that must not change
- Open questions requiring human input

**Scope creep warning:** If during planning you identify unrelated improvements,
list them separately as "Out of scope." They are not part of this refactor.

**STOP here. Show the Refactor Plan and wait for explicit human approval. Do not
proceed without written approval of the plan.**

---

## Step 2 — Route by risk

Read the risk field from the Refactor Plan and follow the corresponding route.

### Low-risk route

Applies when: the refactor is purely internal, no public interfaces change, full
test coverage exists for the affected code, and behavioral impact is isolated to
the refactored module.

Route: Architect (done) → Implementer

Proceed to Step 3a.

### Medium or high-risk route

Applies when: module boundaries change, shared interfaces are affected,
performance characteristics may change, or the refactor touches more than two
files with behavioral impact.

Route: Architect (done) → Implementer → Reviewer

Proceed to Step 3b.

---

## Step 3a — Implementation, low-risk (Implementer role)

Adopt the **Implementer** role as defined in `CLAUDE.md`. Use the approved
Refactor Plan.

1. Read the Refactor Plan before opening any file.
2. Apply only the changes specified in the plan.
3. Run the full test suite before and after — both runs must pass.
4. Produce an Implementation Summary: what changed, what did not change, test
   results before and after.

Any deviation from the plan — including "obvious improvements" encountered
during implementation — must be flagged and held for a separate task.

---

## Step 3b — Implementation, medium/high-risk (Implementer role)

Same rules as Step 3a. Additionally:

- Document any unexpected complexity discovered during implementation.
- Pause and report if complexity changes the risk assessment.
- If new risks are found, **STOP** and report before continuing.

---

## Step 4 — Test suite verification

For all risk levels, confirm:

- All tests that existed before the refactor still pass.
- No test was deleted or commented out to make the suite pass.
- Behavior documented in the Task Card remains unchanged.

If any test fails that was passing before, the refactor has introduced a
regression. **STOP and report.**

---

## Step 5 — Code review (Reviewer role) — medium/high-risk only

Adopt the **Reviewer** role as defined in `CLAUDE.md`. Use the diff and Refactor
Plan.

Verify:

- The implementation matches the approved plan.
- No behavior was changed beyond the plan's scope.
- No unrelated files were modified.

Review Report must include CRITICAL / WARNING / SUGGESTION findings. CRITICAL
findings block completion.

---

## Completion

Report: Refactor Plan (approved), Implementation Summary, test results before
and after, Review Report (if applicable).

The refactor is complete only when: all pre-existing tests still pass, the
implementation matches the approved plan exactly, and no CRITICAL review
findings remain.
