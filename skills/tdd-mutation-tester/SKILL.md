# TDD Mutation Tester

## Core Principles

1. **Verify Assertion Quality**: Coverage percentage can be misleading. Tests must fail when business logic changes.
2. **Mutation Process**:
   - Locate the core logic implemented by the `implementer`.
   - Temporarily mutate a logical operator (e.g. swap `>` for `<`, `==` for `!=`, `+` for `-`, or invert a boolean).
   - Run the test suite.
   - **Expected Result**: At least one test MUST fail.
   - **Clean Up**: Revert the mutated symbol immediately after running the test.
3. **Scorecard**: If the test suite passes even with mutated business logic, report a "0 in Real Coverage" on the scorecard and return the task for better test assertions.
